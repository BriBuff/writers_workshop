# Writer's Workshop<hr>

## Description:

How one writes is a personal, yet sometimes complicated process. Sometimes this means writing on scraps of paper, keeping a journal close by, making storyboards, or just plain writing with no plan whatsoever. Either way, trying to keep track of ideas or skipping ahead is a common issue. This app is meant to help with that. Writers will be able to plan and write at the same time- keeping the writing portion to one side of the screen and the plan to the other. Writers will be able to add, change, delete, and/or update their plan and writing from wherever they are without having to worry about losing ideas once they create a profile.

## Stretch Goals:

### Writing/Plan:

1. Possible dark mode.

2. To eventually find a way to place a text element into canvas.

3. To add multiple different color options to the canvas.

## Challenges:

### Login/Register/Routes:

1. Learning React routes.

2. Making the routes secure once logged in.

3. Making sure the register page would route to the login page after meeting the register requirements.

### React-Canvas-Draw:

1. Integrating the canvas onto the page with Tiny.

2. Attempted to make a draggable text box for the canvas. There wasn't support for that functionality and ultimately had to be scrapped.

### Write:

1. Getting Tiny to let us write in their text box once connected via route and database.
